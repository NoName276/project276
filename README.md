### NAME of the web application: Struggling Student Simulator
Git link: https://github.com/NoName276/project276

### Do we have a clear understanding of the problem?
Currently, the problem of making a multiplayer real-time game in a web application has been solved in various different genres of games published across the internet. For instance, developers have created online games such as Tetris battle, Runescape and Town of Salem which greatly differ in their gameplay mechanics but ultimately share the feature of being multiplayer and real-time web-applications. As a group, we aim to create a competitive multiplayer game that shares similar gameplay mechanics as Frogger while incorporating a musically synchronous feature that would move obstacles following the beat of the music from a music API. Players are to compete with one another in serving drinks from the bar to their customer�s table, successfully bringing the drinks(without spilling them) across the crowded club filled with dancing people (ie dangerous obstacles). This project is designed to be a competitive multiplayer game for entertainment purposes.

The target demographic is casual gamers and individuals who wish to play with their friends while listening to the music of their choice. Fans of Guitar Hero or OSU may also enjoy our unique gameplay idea centered around music synchronization.

### What is the scope of your project?
Does this project have many individual features, or one main feature (a possibility with many subproblems)? These are the �epics� of your project.
This project has one main feature, which will be complemented with several individual features that are also �epic� sized. The main feature for a play will be to have players (servers) can move in (x,y) directions on the nightclub and carry drinks that are to be served at the bar to their assigned table across the hazardous dance floor.

This will be complemented in gameplay with clubbers on the dancefloor acting as obstacles and moving in sync with the music as a secondary �epic� feature; if a server gets hit by a dancer, their drink spills and they must go back to the bar and retrieve a new drink, which spawns randomly. The server who gets the most money by serving drinks wins!

A feature to go along with gaining money would be the ability to spend your earnings on customization features, allowing for a more personalized experience. These could be as simple as changing the outfit of the player to new backgrounds for the �club� to have if said player is the host of a room.

Another �epic� sized feature would be the creation and customization of �rooms� or lobbies in the game. A user would be able to either join and friend�s or make their own. Inside, a host can change their music preferences, have the ability to �boot� unruly/unwanted players and edit the difficulty of the club.

Lastly, the final �epic� sized feature we plan is for a user to access their lifetime stats in their account and read them. These could be something like Win to Lose ratios, amount of games played, average money made per game, total money accumulated, most common served drink, etc.

### What are some sample stories/scenarios? For example, as a regular user to your site, what types of things can I do? These are the �stories� of your project.
There are many scenarios a player may come across that could negatively affect their experience with our game, therefore we have begun to consider possible scenarios in an attempt to prevent a user�s negative experience. For example, a player will likely want to listen to their preferred genre of music, thus they should be allowed to join rooms that play those genres and avoid others. Another player may want the ability to play with their friends in a private room.

Along with that players can also accumulate money to unlock new designs for decorations, backgrounds, and clothes in order to customize the game to their preference. By unlocking features players can create different rooms where players can invite their friends by sharing their room ID. If a player would like to beat their high score they would be able to access it on the home screen along with their win/loss ratio, and total money accumulated.

Before the game starts players can choose their own name/username and avatar color to distinct the players. The difficulty can be chosen by the host/player of the game in the room, where they can decide the speed of the rhythm. If a player is not cooperating during the gameplay. For example, a player may be purposely bumping into other players causing them to continually drop the drinks they were carrying; therefore the host is able to �boot� players out of their room.

### Be honest, is the amount of work required in this proposal enough for five group members
Yes. We have searched deep in our hearts, and we could never lie to you oh great bobby... so yes.
